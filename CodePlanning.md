First thing I need to do for my hangman game is declare the word which will be codecademy. 

Next I will create a function that will display my word as it is being guessed. All letters that havent been gurssed will show a '_' instead of the letter.

Then I will need to add something to accept a user input so I will use the redline module.

After that my game will need a loop to keep it going until the word is 100% complete.

I will also need a way to check the gurssed letters and push them to the guessed letters array.

And lastly I will need a condition to end the game whenever the word is fully guessed.
